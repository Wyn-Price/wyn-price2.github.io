			<h2>Price</h2>

		<div id="Main" style="">
			<p>Our product costs around £5.20 to manufacture, this is because the price of the staples are £1.00 per bag, and the price for the correct amount of crisp packets are £4.20.
			 We do not have to use the school facilities so we will not have to pay to use any facilities. We will sell our product for £7.99 which will make us the profit of £2.79. 
			 The profit will be divided between the 5 of us equally resulting in around 55p profit each, per bag. Each bag takes around 30 minutes to make, so we can make 2 bags every
             hour, so we can make a profit of £4.58 every hour, £1.10p per person, an hour . There is also the cost of this website. The cost is around 2p a day(£7.99 a year)
             That cost is so small, We decided not to include it in our overall price. We also had the idea to hire people to help us manufacture the itmes. They would be close freinds
             and family and could be paid at £2.50 an hour, which is a good pay, considering all they have to do it staple crips packets together. Hiring people at that price would result in 
             a profit of £2.08 an hour, per person we hire. We are currently planning to hire around 5-10 people to help make our bags.
