			<p>our target market is teens aged around 13. Before we had fully decided what our target market was, We made the proto-type, and brought it to school, to show
            the rest of our group, and random people in year 7 and year 8 came up to us and asked us "where we bought that" or "how much did that cost" and some people told us
            "thats a good idea." We then immediatly knew to have our target market people that age. We then researched into the idea of having a target market that are 13 years old.
            We decided to change the size of the bag by 1 Crisp packet per side. We also decided to change the packet of chrips from doritios to skips becuase of this. We then decided to ask
            people in our school about what asking what crisp packets we should use. Here it is:</p>
