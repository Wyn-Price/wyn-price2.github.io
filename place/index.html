			<p>We have decided to only sell our product in Penarth. This is a good idea as we can save lots of Money on
            shipping and can give our products to local shops for no-extra cost. 
            We can also advertise our bags in the area that we are selling them; we can advertise our bags in school. 
            We can also use a website (Like this one) to advertise our bag. If we decided
            to try and sell our bag abroad, it would be a disasters as we would have to pay a lot of money for shipping,
            resulting in a loss of around £5.50 per bag.</p>
