			<p>The way we have promote our product is that we have made its own website which will give information on the product, such as the price and location of shops with it in stock 
            for a click and collect process, this should make the decision to perches one of our fun and colourfully designed bags easy. As the bags would be limated edition, we could say to
            customers that we will only make a certain amount of bags (Lets say 50) and only sell them for a certain time (Lets say a week). This would result in a panic effect where people
            dont have the time to think probably, as the bags will be gone quickly. This means we can over-price the items and still have people buy it. Although this is a very sneaky tactic,
            it would work and we would make more profit than if we sold it normaly.</p>
